## Recommendations

- **Learn Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with these shortcuts for efficient use of Jupyter Notebooks.

- **Save Work Regularly**: While Jupyter auto-saves, manually saving your work often is a good practice.

- **Be Courageous**: Experiment - Jupyter allows easy reversion of changes.

- **Restart Kernel for Troubleshooting**: If the notebook is unresponsive, try restarting the kernel. This will clear all outputs and variables. Then re-run the notebook.

- **Use 'Restart & Run All'**: To confirm that the entire notebook runs smoothly from start to finish, use the "Restart & Run All" feature under the Kernel menu.

- **Keep Cells Small**: Write code in small, manageable cells for easier debugging.

- **Document With Markdown**: Regularly add Markdown cells to document your process, organize your notebook, and explain the code.
