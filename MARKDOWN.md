# Markdown Syntax and Recommendations

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text documents.
It is widely used in GitHub repositories to format README files
and in Jupyter notebooks to format text cells.
Learning Markdown can enhance your ability to communicate professionally
and present your work in a clear and engaging manner.

## Markdown Syntax

### Headings

Use `#` for headings.
More `#` symbols mean a smaller heading.
Leave a space after the last hash symbol before providing the heading text.

### Lists

- Unordered List: Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens.
- Ordered List: Use numbers.

Leave a space after the symbol before providing the list text.

### Links

To add a link, wrap the link text in brackets and then follow it
immediately with the URL in parentheses: `[Link Text](URL)`

### Command and Code Fencing

Use backticks to create code blocks. For inline code, use a single backtick on each side. For larger blocks of code, use three backticks or indent with four spaces.

### Examples
