# Specification for Project 4 Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

Project 4 uses a combination of Python and Markdown to create a compelling data story using exploratory data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook. The project includes a project virtual environment with  popular libraries for data analytics including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Deliverable Names

- GitHub Repository:  datafun-03-jupyter
- Documentation:      README.md
- Notebook:           yourname_eda.ipynb

Create a new GitHub repository with a README.md. Create a new Jupyter Notebook with the specified name. Feel free to use a pseudonym or brand name.

### Version Control with Git

Use Git for version control.
In your README.md, document the steps of  initializing a new project in GitHub, creating a Jupyter Notebook, and managing notebook versions with Git.
Explain the process for creating the repository in both places,
and document your workflow and commands as you edit, add, commit, and push to GitHub.

## Module Specification

### Objective

Develop a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates skills in exploratory data analysis using pandas and seaborn. 
The notebook should tell a data story, presenting findings in a clear and engaging manner.

### Requirements

#### 1. Environment Setup

Set up a Python virtual environment for the project.
Document the process and packages used in your README.
Note your operating system and provide the exact commands and process you used on your machine.
You do not have to provide commands for other operating systems.

Add a .gitignore file to your project to exclude the virtual environment folder, your .vscode settings folder, and any other files that do not need to be committed to GitHub.

#### 2. Set Up Jupyter Notebook

Document the process of setting up Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
Select an appropriate kernel for the notebook.

#### 2. Import Project Packages

Organize your project imports following conventions.
For example, standard library imports first, then external library imports, then local module imports.

#### 3. Gather Data

Use the requests library to fetch data from specified web APIs or online data sources - or use data sets available in the seaborn or other imported libraries.

#### 4. Data Analysis with Pandas

Use pandas to load, clean, and manipulate the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns.

#### 5. Data Visualization with Seaborn

Use seaborn to create visualizations that aid in telling your data story.
Include a variety of chart types to showcase different aspects of the data.

#### 6. Notebook Structure and Documentation

Organize your notebook into sections with clear headers.
Include markdown cells to explain your analysis and findings.
Comment your code cells for clarity.

#### 7. Storytelling and Presentation

Craft a narrative around your data analysis.
Present your findings in a logical and engaging manner.

### Notebook Execution

Execute the notebook and ensure it runs without errors before committing and pushing your final version to GitHub.
Verify it renders correctly when viewed on GitHub.

### Notebook Design

- Include a project summary at the top of the notebook with a title, author, date and the purpose of the project.
- The code and presentation should be clear, well-organized, and demonstrate good practices.
- Include Markdown section headings and comments for clarity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The project should be functional and meet all requirements.
- Documentation: The project should be well-written and well-documented.
- Presentation: The project should be presented in a clear and organized manner.
- Professionalism: The project should be submitted on-time and reflect an original, creative effort.
